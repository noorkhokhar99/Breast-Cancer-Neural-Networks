# Description

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons (analogous to biological neurons in an animal brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal from one to another. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the synapse signal is a real number, and the output of each neuron is calculated by a non-linear function of the sum of its input. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Further, they may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal is below (or above) that level is the downstream signal sent.
